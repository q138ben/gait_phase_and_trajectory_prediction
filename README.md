# gait_phase_and_trajectory_prediction
This project is to predict multi-step gait phases and gait trajectory

Lower body segment trajectory and gait phase prediction is crucial for the control of
assistance-as-needed robotic devices, such as exoskeletons. In order for a powered exoskeleton
with phase-based control to determine and provide proper assistance to the wearer during gait, we
propose an approach to predict segment trajectories up to 200 ms ahead (angular velocity of the
thigh, shank and foot segments) and five gait phases (loading response, mid-stance, terminal stance,
preswing and swing), based on collected data from inertial measurement units placed on the thighs,
shanks, and feet.
